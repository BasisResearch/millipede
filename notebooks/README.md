## Example notebooks

We include several example notebooks to help users get started with millipede.
Each demonstrates how to use millipede for a different kind of response data type.
For example, if you have binary-valued responses check out [bernoulli_likelihood_demo.ipynb](bernoulli_likelihood_demo.ipynb)
or [higgs_vignette.ipynb](higgs_vignette.ipynb).
